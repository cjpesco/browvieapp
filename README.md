# browvieapp
In this project I learned how to use ListView build with a customize card in it,
fetch data from model objects, use Navigator.push with MaterialPageRoute to go the details page,
Learn to use Stack and LinearGradient, practice MediaQuery and SizedBox,
ClipRRect, Text.rich with TextSpan, and HorizontalLine to create this Browse Movies with Details app.
